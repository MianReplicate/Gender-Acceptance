## Introduction 📜
Topic of Gender is a mod that adds traits revolving around transphobia, cisphobia, and chasers to RimWorld. **It does not add transgender people on its own, you need a transgender mod for that, see later in the description**

It also contains built in patches for mods such as Way Better Romance and Intimacy - A Lovin' Expansion.

## Additions ➕
- Cisphobia and Transphobia work how you'd expect them to. Pawns with these traits will despise cisgender or transgender pawns.
  - There's "fog of war!" Transphobic pawns don't automatically know who is trans and have to find out through trans pawns voluntarily coming out or through.. accidents.
  - Watch out when accepting transgender or cisgender pawns, the phobic pawns won't be very happy with your decision!
- Chaser trait - Chasers find the transgender identity exotic, often desiring to be intimate with them from time to time in order to be content. They will seek out transgender individuals more often for romance and love making.
  - Transgender pawns may feel dehumanized after the lovin'
- Transgender individuals are more fond of one another as they relate to being transgender.
- Pawns may misgender transgender individuals whether purposefully or on accident.
- Pawns may transvestigate from time to time, and they can grow suspicious.
- Precept and ideologies for the Ideology DLC relating to acceptance of transgender individuals.

## Final Message 💖
Trans rights 🏳️‍⚧️ and intersex rights are human rights. This mod was not made with the intention to dehumanize transgender people but rather to add drama to an already dramatic game. 

If you are transphobic, feel free to kindly fuck off, downvote, and leave a jester steam award <3.
